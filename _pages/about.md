## Bio

I am a first-year Ph.D. student from [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](http://cispa.saarland/), supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/people/backes/) and daily work with [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). Prior to joining CISPA, I got my master degree in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University (ZJU), under the supervision of [Prof. Peng Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cp) and worked at 2012 Labs@Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. for two years as an operating system engineer.

My research interests include <b>biomedical privacy</b> and <b>machine learning privacy</b>. I would like to investigate noval attack surfaces in different data processing scenarios, quantify the privacy risks and develop privacy-preserving methods to mitigtate the discovered risks.
