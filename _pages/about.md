## Bio

Hello! My name is Min Chen, I am a first-year Ph.D. student from [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](http://cispa.saarland/), supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/people/backes/) and daily work with [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). Prior to joining CISPA, I got my bachelor degree from Lanzhou University (2014) and master degree from Zhejiang University (2017), then I worked at 2012 Labs@Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. for two years as an operating system engineer.

My research interests include <b>biomedical privacy</b> and <b>machine learning privacy</b>. I would like to investigate novel attack surfaces in different data processing scenarios, quantify the privacy risks and develop privacy-preserving methods to mitigate the discovered risks.
