Bio
======
I am a first-year Ph.D. student from [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](http://cispa.saarland/), co-supervised by [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.saarland/people/backes/) and [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). Prior to joining CISPA, I graduated from Zhejiang University (ZJU) with the Master's degree in Control Science and Engineering, under the supervision of [Prof. Peng Cheng](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cp) and worked at 2012 Labs Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. for two years as an operating system engineer.

My current research interests include biomedical privacy and machine learning privacy.
